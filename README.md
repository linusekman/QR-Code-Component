## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Trying to make it fit the design more accurately forced me to use different sizing for the text. Had I not made the paragraph a bigger size than 15px I would've had to use <br> tags to have the text break where the design breaks the text.

Also for future assignments thats more complicated break down the design early and try to sketch or divide the design into parts so its easier to implement. Would certainly save me alot of time doing the thinking work before putting into vscode.

### Continued development

Using this assignment as a launchpad to hopefully do more of the assignments and develop more front-end skills. I really want to build more "complete" and robust projects and not just components. But for now this is the stepping stone.
